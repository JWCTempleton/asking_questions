### Name at least one thing your question should always include.

When asking for help your question should always include the non working code as well as any context necessary for the problem: explain what you're trying to do, the exact steps you took to produce the problem, what you expect, and what you actually see, including the error and the line where the error was thrown. Any strange UI behavior that can't be expressed with code should have a screenshot taken of it.

### Describe the "XY Problem"

The XY Problem is when a person asks for help with their intended solution, not help with their actual problem. An example is a person wants to have a result of X. They don't know how to get that result but they have an idea that it could be done with solution Y, which they also don't know how to do, so they ask for help with Y. The person being asked is confused because Y seems like a strange thing to try to do. After time is wasted trying to solve Y it becomes clear that the user was actually trying to find the result of X. It might even be the case that Y wasn't even a suitable solution to get the result of X.

The way to avoid the XY problem is to always include information about a broader picture along with any attempted solution and to provide details for when asked for them. If you believe you have ruled out other solutions list them and your reasons why they have been ruled out.

### Describe three attributes of a "help vampire"

Help vampires don't google for solutions before asking, don't ask specific questions with context, and ask overly broad, impossible to answer questions ('how do I build a forum?').
